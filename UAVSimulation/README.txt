Compile the uavEnd cpp to have the program act as UAV simulation. Currently, it only receives up to 6 points
and displays them to console output. Hard code the IP address of the machine the simulation is running on onto 
the gsclient cpp of the ground station. The port number of the simulation is hard coded to be 30010, which 
is the same number that the ground station is hard coded to send to.
